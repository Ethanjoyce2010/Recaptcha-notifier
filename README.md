# CAPTCHA Detection & Visibility Notifier

Short: Detects whether a page uses reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, or Cloudflare Turnstile and notifies you with a beautiful on-screen alert.

## Why

As [CHUPPL explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsBP21-XpI), reCAPTCHA isn't just about blocking bots. It quietly tracks your mouse movements, clicks, IP, and browser fingerprint‚Äîbuilding profiles across millions of sites.

Researchers and lawsuits suggest it's poor at stopping bots but effective at surveillance and even unpaid labor for Google's AI.

This script makes CAPTCHA systems visible so you know when they're watching.

## Install

1. Install a userscript manager (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey).  
2. Create a new userscript and paste the contents of `userscript.js`, or install via your manager's "Add from file" feature.

## Usage / Test

- Open any website. On first run you'll see a dialog asking your preferred alert behavior. Choose one.  
- If a page contains a CAPTCHA (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, or Turnstile), you'll get a color-coded alert indicating which type is in use.
- If none is found, you'll see a green checkmark alert saying it does NOT use CAPTCHA.  
- If a CAPTCHA appears later (injected dynamically), the script will notify you when it shows up.  
- Use the ‚öôÔ∏è button on any alert to reopen settings and change the fade behavior anytime.

## Alert Types

- **Red Gradient (‚ö†Ô∏è):** reCAPTCHA detected - Google is tracking you
- **Orange Gradient (üõ°Ô∏è):** hCaptcha detected - Alternative CAPTCHA system
- **Purple Gradient (‚òÅÔ∏è):** Cloudflare Turnstile detected - Cloudflare verification
- **Green Gradient (‚úì):** No CAPTCHA detected - You're clear!

## Notes

- Metadata in the userscript requests `GM_addStyle`, `GM_setValue`, and `GM_getValue`. The script also supports the modern `GM.*` promise-based API and falls back to `localStorage`.  
- If you want strict modern-GM behavior only, you can adjust the `@grant` or remove the fallback logic in the script.
